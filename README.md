## Projects Overview

| Project | Description | Tools/Tech | Outcome |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Resume Screening Using NLP | Built a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF to automatically screen resumes and reduce manual shortlisting time. | Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, TF-IDF | 93% accuracy; reduced manual shortlisting by 70% |
| Dog vs Cat Image Classification | CNN-based image classifier for binary classification on Kaggle dataset with data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning. | Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV | 95% accuracy |
| Titanic Survival Prediction | Logistic Regression model with feature engineering and GridSearchCV to predict survival chances of passengers. | Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib | 82% accuracy; visualized insights with Python |
| House Price Prediction | Regression model trained on 5000+ records to predict house prices; deployed via Streamlit for interactive interface. | Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pandas | Interactive web app for predictions |
| IoT Projects | Arduino-based IoT systems including an Automatic Toll Gate and Real-time Viral Symptoms Detection using ESP32 and sensors. | Arduino, ESP32, Sensors, Python | Functional prototypes for automation and health monitoring |
